    <h1>MY JOURNEY IN WEB PROGRAMMING</h1><hr>
    <p>
  Web programming has made an impact in our educational level.Alfred wasnt your typical programmer.
  He didnt have a degree in computer science or a fantacy for tech job.Instead ,he worked as a librarain 
  in a small town,surrounded by books,dusty shelves,and the quiet hum of readers flipping pages.
  But Alfred had a secret:he loved programming particularly web development.</p>
